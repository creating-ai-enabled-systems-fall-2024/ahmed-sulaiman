Guelzo pg.', 'Guelzo pg. 18-19 There were few people who strongly or directly influenced Lincoln’s moral and intellectual development and perspectives.', 'Virginia, which had repeatedly warned Lincoln that it would not allow an invasion of its territory or join an attack on another state, responded by seceding, along with North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas. The slave states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware did not secede, and Lincoln urgently negotiated with state leaders there, promising not to interfere with slavery.', \"Lincoln's formal education consisted of about 18 months of schooling. Largely self-educated, he read every book he could get his hands on, once walking.\", 'The goal was to emphasize the superior power of \"free labor,\" whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. Thomas (1952) p 216; Reinhard H. Luthin, The First Lincoln Campaign (1944); Nevins vol 4; On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected as the 16th President of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and John Bell of the new Constitutional Union Party.', 'One, Clement Vallandigham, was exiled; but all of the remainder were released, usually after two or three months (see: Ex parte Merryman).

Another primary objective of Fillmore was to preserve the Union from the intensifying slavery debate.', 'Fillmore signaled this shift by appointing Daniel Webster as his Secretary of State. As president, Fillmore dealt with increasing party divisions within the Whig party; party harmony became one of his primary objectives.', \"Official White House portrait of Millard FillmoreFillmore ascended to the presidency upon the sudden and unexpected death of President Taylor in July 1850.

Fillmore was Taylor's Vice President and assumed the presidency after Taylor's sudden death from a stomach ailment. Fillmore served the remainder of Taylor's term until 1853.

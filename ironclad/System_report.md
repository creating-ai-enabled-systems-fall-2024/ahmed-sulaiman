## Overview

This system is designed for efficient visual similarity searches in face embeddings, enabling image-based identity recognition and retrieval. The system consists of three primary services:

1. **Extraction Service**: Manages preprocessing and embedding extraction.
2. **Retrieval Service**: Builds and queries the FAISS index.
3. **Interface Service**: Provides a REST API for external interactions.

```

### Service Descriptions

#### 1. Extraction Service
The **Extraction Service** preprocesses images and extracts embeddings. Images are resized and normalized before passing through the `vggface2` or `casia-webface` models, generating embeddings used in nearest-neighbor searches.

- **Design Impact**: The choice of model and preprocessing steps greatly impacts the robustness of the retrieval service. VGGFace2 and Casia-Webface models were selected due to their accuracy in face recognition tasks, with VGGFace2 offering higher accuracy at a slightly increased resource cost. This configuration prioritizes accurate identity matching, crucial for applications requiring reliable identification.

#### 2. Retrieval Service
The **Retrieval Service** manages the FAISS index of all gallery embeddings. Using FAISS, the service performs fast k-nearest neighbor searches with scalable configurations for large datasets.

- **Design Impact**: The type of FAISS index chosen affects retrieval performance and scalability. We configured FAISS with a flat index for smaller datasets and an Inverted File (IVF) index for scalability to billions of images. This setup ensures that even large datasets can be searched with low latency, meeting real-time performance requirements without sacrificing accuracy.

#### 3. Interface Service
The **Interface Service** offers API endpoints for identification (`/identify`), gallery updates (`/add`), and history retrieval (`/history`). It handles user interactions, enabling real-time responses for identity recognition and gallery management.

- **Design Impact**: API design impacts user experience and system performance, especially for high-concurrency use cases. The endpoints are designed to handle high-volume requests efficiently, with `/identify` focusing on low-latency retrieval, `/add` supporting incremental gallery updates, and `/history` enabling transparency and auditability. These endpoints facilitate easy system integration.

### Justification of Configuration Choices

Each component’s configuration is designed to balance accuracy, scalability, and responsiveness:

1. **Embedding Model**: VGGFace2 provides robust embeddings with high accuracy, essential for identity matching in diverse environments.
2. **Embedding Dimension**: A 512-dimensional embedding balances accuracy with computational load.
3. **FAISS Index Type**: IVF-PQ indexing optimizes speed and scalability, especially with high-dimensional embeddings.
4. **API Design**: Endpoints support flexibility and scalability, allowing for seamless integration with other applications.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: The `/history` endpoint allows for offline evaluation and performance tracking, helping to detect bottlenecks and inaccuracies.

### System Complexity and Trade-offs

- **Scalability**: The FAISS index choice directly impacts scalability. While the flat index offers precision, it scales poorly, making IVF-PQ a better choice for large datasets.
- **Latency**: Higher values of `k` improve recall but increase latency, impacting response time.
- **Embedding Robustness**: Using a high-quality model (VGGFace2) enhances retrieval but requires more computation. Casia-Webface, while faster, is slightly less accurate, especially with noisy images.

### Weaknesses and Mitigation Strategies

- **Resource Intensity**: The system can be resource-intensive with large data loads, especially with VGGFace2. Model quantization and load balancing can help manage resource use.
- **Noise Sensitivity**: Image noise can reduce embedding accuracy. Adding preprocessing denoising steps can help stabilize embedding quality.
- **Latency with High k**: Setting `k=5` balances accuracy and speed, while caching frequent queries can reduce latency under high concurrency.

## Metrics Definition

### Offline Metrics

Offline metrics evaluate system performance during development, ensuring embedding quality and retrieval effectiveness:

1. **Precision@k**: Measures the proportion of true matches in the top `k` retrieved results. High precision is crucial for accurate identity retrieval, ensuring relevant matches appear consistently in the top results.
   - **Usage**: Calculated during validation to compare how accurately different embedding models retrieve identities. A high Precision@k indicates effective retrieval, supporting user needs for quick and accurate results.

2. **Recall@k**: Determines the proportion of relevant identities retrieved in the top `k` results, ensuring comprehensive search results.
   - **Usage**: Recall@k is particularly useful when the system needs to present multiple relevant results, such as in forensics or security applications. High recall ensures that important identities are included, minimizing missed matches.

3. **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**: Averages precision scores across different rank positions, providing insight into overall ranking quality.
   - **Usage**: We compute mAP to evaluate ranking performance and compare embedding models, with higher mAP values reflecting better ranking consistency. This ensures that correct identities are highly ranked, which is crucial for retrieval quality.

4. **Embedding Robustness Score**: Measures embedding stability across varied inputs, including noisy images, by calculating cosine similarity.
   - **Usage**: This metric assesses the model’s resilience to real-world variations. Stable embeddings across different noise levels indicate robustness, maintaining retrieval accuracy in diverse environments.

5. **Indexing Latency**: Measures the time taken to add a new identity to the gallery index, a factor in system scalability.
   - **Usage**: Monitoring indexing latency helps assess how quickly new data can be added, affecting system responsiveness. This metric is essential for applications requiring frequent updates.

### Online Metrics

Online metrics monitor real-time system performance and user experience, helping identify issues quickly:

1. **Search Latency**: Measures the response time for the `/identify` endpoint.
   - **Monitoring**: Latency alerts are set for response times over 1 second, ensuring timely detection of issues and responsive adjustments. This metric is critical for maintaining responsiveness, which is key for user satisfaction.

2. **API Throughput**: Tracks requests per second, essential for high-concurrency support.
   - **Monitoring**: Throughput is continuously tracked, allowing for detection of spikes or drops in usage. This monitoring ensures that the system can handle peak demand effectively.

3. **Error Rate**: Monitors failed requests, identifying potential stability issues.
   - **Monitoring**: Alerts are set for error rates above 2%, indicating a possible systemic issue that requires immediate attention.

4. **Identification Accuracy**: Tracks correct matches in real-time to validate live accuracy.
   - **Monitoring**: Accuracy checks are periodically conducted through sampled reviews, establishing a benchmark for live performance and ensuring model consistency in real-time applications.

5. **Index Update Latency**: Measures latency for the `/add` endpoint, ensuring timely updates.
   - **Monitoring**: Latency tracking and alerts help maintain update responsiveness, crucial for systems with dynamically changing galleries.

### Monitoring Strategy

Using **Prometheus and Grafana**:
- **Latency Alerts**: Configured for search latencies above 1 second.
- **Error Rate Alerts**: Set for error rates above 2%.
- **Weekly Audits**: Regular audits of logs and performance data to ensure system health.

Monitoring provides real-time insights into system health, identifying areas for intervention and maintaining user experience.

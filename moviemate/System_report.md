# **System Report**

## **1. System Design**

### **System Overview**
The system is a Docker-enabled movie recommendation platform that includes:
- A **Personalization Service** to recommend movies based on user preferences and past interactions.
- An **Adaptive Service** to handle new users (cold start) and update the recommendation models based on drift detection.
- An **Interface Service** to manage user data and provide RESTful endpoints for recommendations.

1. **Personalization Service**:
   - Combines Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Cold Start Recommenders.
   - Provides personalized and diverse recommendations.

2. **Adaptive Service**:
   - Detects model drift using distribution comparison techniques like Population Stability Index (PSI).
   - Supports model retraining triggered by significant drift.

3. **Interface Service**:
   - API endpoints to add users, manage login, and retrieve recommendations.
   - Enables seamless integration with external systems.

### **Configurable Parameters**
| **Service**              | **Parameter**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Personalization Service  | `n_recommendations`        | Number of top recommendations to generate.                                     |
| Personalization Service  | `diversity_factor`         | Balances popular vs. niche recommendations using Maximal Marginal Relevance.   |
| Adaptive Service         | `drift_threshold`          | Threshold for drift detection (e.g., PSI > 0.2 triggers retraining).           |
| Interface Service        | `max_requests_per_user`    | Maximum number of API requests allowed per user per minute.                    |
| Adaptive Service         | `retraining_frequency`     | Frequency of retraining models (e.g., weekly, monthly).                        |

## **2. Metrics Definition**

### **Offline Metrics**
**Purpose**: Offline metrics evaluate the system’s effectiveness based on historical data without requiring user interaction. These metrics include:
- **Precision@N**: Measures the relevance of the top-N recommendations.
- **Recall@N**: Measures the proportion of relevant items recommended.
- **nDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**: Evaluates the ranking quality, giving higher importance to relevant items appearing earlier in the recommendation list.

*Monitoring*: Offline metrics are computed periodically (e.g., weekly) using a test dataset to ensure model quality remains high.

### **Online Metrics**
**Purpose**: Online metrics measure the system’s real-world performance based on user interactions. These metrics include:
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**: Percentage of recommended items clicked by users.
- **Engagement Rate**: Average time spent on recommended content.
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of recommendations that lead to a desired outcome (e.g., watching a movie).

*Monitoring*: Online metrics are monitored in real-time using analytics dashboards. Alerts are configured to flag significant drops in performance.

## **3. Analysis of Designing Parameters and Configurations**

### **Design Decision 1: Recommendation Model Mix**
**Significance**: Combining Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and Cold Start recommendations improves personalization and handles diverse user behaviors.

**Alternatives Explored**:
1. **Collaborative Filtering Only**: Performs well for active users but struggles with new users (cold start).
2. **Content-Based Only**: Handles cold start better but lacks collaborative diversity.
3. **Hybrid Model (Current Approach)**: Combines strengths of both.

**Evaluation**:
- **Metric**: Precision@N, Recall@N, nDCG.
- **Results**:
  | Model                  | Precision@10 | Recall@10 | nDCG@10 |
  |------------------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
  | Collaborative Filtering| 0.45         | 0.30      | 0.40     |
  | Content-Based          | 0.40         | 0.35      | 0.38     |
  | Hybrid Model           | 0.50         | 0.40      | 0.45     |

**Conclusion**: The hybrid model shows the best overall performance.

### **Design Decision 2: Diversity Factor**
**Significance**: Diversifying recommendations ensures users discover less popular but relevant items, improving user satisfaction.

**Alternatives Explored**:
1. **No Diversity**: Recommendations are based purely on relevance.
2. **Diverse Re-ranking**: Incorporates a diversity factor using Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR).

**Evaluation**:
- **Metric**: User Engagement Rate (measured via A/B testing).
- **Results**:
  | Diversity Factor | Engagement Rate |
  |------------------|-----------------|
  | 0.0 (No Diversity)| 15%             |
  | 0.5               | 20%             |
  | 1.0 (High Diversity)| 18%           |

**Conclusion**: A balanced diversity factor of 0.5 maximizes engagement.

### **Design Decision 3: Drift Detection Threshold**
**Significance**: A well-tuned drift threshold ensures timely retraining without excessive computation costs.

**Alternatives Explored**:
1. **Low Threshold (PSI = 0.1)**: Frequent retraining, high cost.
2. **High Threshold (PSI = 0.3)**: Delayed retraining, risk of performance degradation.
3. **Moderate Threshold (PSI = 0.2)**: Balanced approach.

**Evaluation**:
- **Metric**: Offline Precision@10 before and after drift.
- **Results**:
  | Threshold (PSI) | Pre-Drift Precision | Post-Drift Precision |
  |-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
  | 0.1             | 0.50                | 0.50                  |
  | 0.2             | 0.50                | 0.48                  |
  | 0.3             | 0.50                | 0.44                  |

**Conclusion**: A drift threshold of PSI = 0.2 balances precision and retraining costs.

### **Design Decision 4: Cold Start Strategy**
**Significance**: Effective handling of new users improves user retention and initial experience.

**Alternatives Explored**:
1. **Popular Recommendations**: Show top globally popular items.
2. **Genre-Based Recommendations**: Show top items in user-specified genres.

**Evaluation**:
- **Metric**: Initial Click-Through Rate (CTR) for new users.
- **Results**:
  | Strategy            | CTR   |
  |---------------------|-------|
  | Popular Recommendations| 12%|
  | Genre-Based Recommendations| 15%|

**Conclusion**: Genre-based recommendations provide a better initial experience.

### **Design Decision 5: API Rate Limiting**
**Significance**: Prevents abuse and ensures system stability.

**Alternatives Explored**:
1. **No Rate Limiting**: Risk of system overload.
2. **Fixed Limit (50 requests/min)**: Balances stability and usability.
3. **Dynamic Limit (based on user activity)**: Tailored limits.

**Evaluation**:
- **Metric**: System uptime and average latency.
- **Results**:
  | Rate Limiting Strategy | Uptime (%) | Average Latency (ms) |
  |------------------------|------------|-----------------------|
  | No Limit               | 85%        | 250                   |
  | Fixed Limit            | 99%        | 100                   |
  | Dynamic Limit          | 99%        | 110                   |

**Conclusion**: Fixed limits ensure system stability without noticeable performance degradation.
